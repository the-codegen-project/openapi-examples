		"description": "# Online Shop REST API\nThis document describes the REST API for [online shop](https://webshop.one.com). The API can be used to develop new apps or integrations for the online shop.\n\n# Authentication\nThe REST API uses bearer authentication method. In this authentication method the API user must send the JWT token provided by the Online Shop in the `Authorization` request header while accessing any REST API endpoint.\n\nAuthorization request header\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer <your token goes here>\n```\n\n\n# Get the authentication token\nYou can get the [authentication token](#section/Authentication) by adding an app to your [online shop](https://webshop.one.com). \n\n1. Login to your [online shop](https://webshop.one.com)\n2. Create a URL with the query params as shown below and paste it in the browser. \n```\nhttps://webshop.one.com/apps?clientId=<client-id>&clientSecret=<client-secret>&name=<app-name>&description=<app-description>&redirectUrl=<redirect-url-to-receive-token>&supportEmail=<contact-email>&supportPhone=<contact-phone-number>&supportLink=<Link-to-support-page>&logoImageUrl=<link-to-image>&disconnectUrl=<receive-notification-when-disconnected>&helpLink=<link-to-help-page-of-app>&createAccountLink=<link-to-account-creation-page>&accessKey=<access-key>&configurationEndPoint=<Link-to-redirect-configuration-end-point>&isConfigurationRequiredEndPoint=<link-to-end-point-to-check-if-configuration-is-required>\n```\n3. You will be presented with a dialog to accept or cancel adding new of app, once you accept to add the new app then online shop will redirect you to the `redirectUrl` (from the provided query params) with an `instant-token`. \n4. Use the `instant-token` to get the actual API token from the [API-token end point](#tag/AUTH/paths/~1auth~1token~1new/post). \n5. Once you have the actual API token you can validate it at the [token validation end point](#tag/AUTH/paths/~1api~1v2~1auth~1token~1validate/post). \n6. Securely preserve the API token to access the REST API or [renew](#tag/AUTH/paths/~1api~1v2~1auth~1token~1renew/post) your token.\n\n\n\n#### List of URL query params\n| **Query param name**       | **Required or Optional** | **Description - example**                                                       |\n| ---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| clientId             | required                 | A unique Id for your App. Example: com.example                                          |\n| clientSecret         | required                 | A secret key for your App. Example: some-secret-key                                     | \n| name                 | required                 | Name of your App. Example: Acme corp.

Each subpayment method should be associated with one custom payment method.\n\n* **Payment app developer:** The one who is integrating the custom payment with the system\n\n* **Custom subpayment Name:** This serves as a unique identifier for each subpayment method, formed by combining the payment method name and subpayment method with an underscore (_). For instance, if the payment method name is `A` and the subpayment method is `card`, the custom subpayment name will be `A_card`.\n\n* **Order Intent:**   Refers to the intention behind a customer's action to place an order. A unique order intent will be created during the [Create an order](#tag/STOREFRONT-ORDER/paths/~1storefront~1order/post) request\n\n* **Order Intent Key:** A unique identifier associated with each order intent.\n\n* **Process payment api:** This API is responsible for managing the redirection from the payment gateway or from the Payment app developer, as well as processing payments. Upon successful processing by this API, an order will be created. The API accepts two query parameters.\n   1. <b>paymentStatus</b>: This parameter indicates the status of the payment and can have values \"success\" or \"failure\".\n   2. <b>redirectUrl</b>: This parameter specifies a valid URL to which the server will redirect once it processes the request.\n\n* **Instant Payment:** A payment method enabling immediate transaction processing and completion, typically offering instant payment confirmation. If the custom payment method is instant, orders will be created and captured instantly following successful redirection from the payment gateway.\n\n* **Delayed Payment:** This refers to a payment method where the server must await webhooks to update the payment status. If an order is created with a delayed payment method, the `process payment API` request will only create the order without marking it as captured. The server will wait for the payment success or failure webhook event to update the status accordingly.\n\n* **Checkout URL:** During the addition of [custom payment methods](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1payments/post), the Checkout URL should be provided in the URL section. Payment app developers can use this URL to initiate an intent/order within the gateway with each request made during the order creation process.\n\n* **Verify URL:** The verification URL should also be provided in the designated URL section. Upon each request made to this URL, app developers can return the status of the payment checkout. Accepted values include \"COMPLETED\" or \"FAILED\".\n    - **COMPLETED**: Signifies the completion of the checkout flow.\n    - **FAILED**: Indicates either the user canceled the checkout flow or an unexpected issue occurred.\n\n* **Capture URL:** This URL is optional for [custom payment methods](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1payments/post) and is only required if the gateway chooses to handle payment capture programmatically after the checkout process is completed. The server will invoke this API subsequent to its call to the verify URL, provided that the status returned is COMPLETED.\n\n* **Refund URL:**  The refund URL should also be provided in the designated URL section. Upon each request made to this URL, app developers can submit a refund request in the gateway. The Server will wait for the refund success/failure  event on [payment webhook](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1storefront~1webhook~1payment/post) api to update the refund status in the database.\n\n* **SuccessCallback:** This is the URL to be provided in the [Create an order](#tag/STOREFRONT-ORDER/paths/~1storefront~1order/post) request, determining the page that the user should be directed to upon successful payment completion.\n\n* **CancelCallback:** This is the URL to be provided in the [Create an order](#tag/STOREFRONT-ORDER/paths/~1storefront~1order/post) request, determining the page that the user should be directed to after a failed payment attempt.\n\n\n## Step 1: Adding and Updating Custom Payment Methods.\nAdd and update custom payment and sub payments methods using below apis.\n* [Add custom Payment](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1payments/post)\n* [Update custom Payment](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1payments~1:paymentId/put)\n* [Add custom sub payment](tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1payments/post)\n* [Update custom sub payment](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1payments~1sub/post)\n\n## Step 2: Creating a New Order\n1. Use the [Create an order](#tag/STOREFRONT-ORDER/paths/~1storefront~1order/post) api with the custom subpayment name as the `transactionType`. Retrieve the subpayment name using the [Get custom Payment](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1payments~1:paymentId/get).<br>\nThis api will generate a temporary order, retrievable using the [order intent key](#tag/STOREFRONT-ORDER/paths/~1storefront~1order~1:orderIntentKey/get). A valid order will only be created once the user completes the checkout flow.\n\n## Step 3: Processing the Order\n1. During order request processing,The server initiates a call to the checkout URL provided during custom payment addition ([Add custom payment](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1payments/post)).<br> Payment app developers can use this api call to initiate an intent/order within the gateway.<br>\n    <br>Request format:\n    ```\n    method: POST\n    Payload\n    {\n        \"orderIntentKey\": \"string\",\n        \"callbacks\": {\n            \"successUrl\": \"string\",\n            \"cancelUrl\": \"string\"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    - ***orderIntentKey:*** Use this to get order details using [Get shop order](#tag/STOREFRONT-ORDER/paths/~1storefront~1order~1:orderIntentKey/get) API.\n    - ***callbacks:*** These are intended to be submitted to the payment gateway as the success and failure/cancel URLs.\n    - ***successUrl*** : This will be [Process payment](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1storefront~1process-payment/get) API endpoint with` paymentStatus=success` and `redirectUrl=successCallback` parameters, as provided in the create order request.\n    - ***cancelUrl*** : This will be [Process payment](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1storefront~1process-payment/get) API endpoint with` paymentStatus=failure` and `redirectUrl=cancelCallback` parameters, as provided in the create order request. \n   \n\n3. It expects a response containing the gateway chekout page url(`redirectUrl`) and unique identifier for each chekout request(`transactionId`).<br>Expected response format:\n    ``` \n    {\n        \"data\": {\n                \"redirectUrl\": \"string\",\n                \"transactionId\": \"string\"\n            }\n    }\n    ```\n\n>If the payment gateway only allows for a single callback URL during order/intent creation, or if the gateway provides the status through an additional API call, it becomes the responsibility of the payment developer to verify the status and redirect it to the process payment URL. <br>\nIn these situations, developers should refrain from providing the callback URLs provided in the `checkout` request to the gateway. Instead, they should provide their own endpoint to handle the redirection directly and subsequently redirect it to the success or cancel URL provided in the checkout API payload based on the obtained status. <br>\nAdditionally, the success or cancel URL can be dynamically generated as needed.<br>\nEg:If the payment gateway return success/failure in the status then reidrect the request to process-payment-api?paymentStatus=success/failure&redirectUrl=successCallback/cancelCallback\n\n## Step 4: Handle the Create an order response\n1. Utilize the redirectUrl provided in the [Create an order](#tag/STOREFRONT-ORDER/paths/~1storefront~1order/post) response to guide the user to the checkout page.\n\n    [Create an order](#tag/STOREFRONT-ORDER/paths/~1storefront~1order/post) Response format:\n    ```\n        {\n            \"status\": \"Success\",\n            \"data\": {\n                \"redirectUrl\": \"string\", //the redirectUrl obtained from the checkout url.\n                \"transactionId\": \"string\", //the transactionId obtained from the checkout url.\n                \"orderIntentKey\": \"string\"\n            }\n        }\n    ```\n## Step 5: Payment Completion and Verification:(user completed/cancelled the checkout)\n1. After the user completes or cancels the checkout, the payment gateway redirects them to the [Process payment](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1storefront~1process-payment/get) URL provided by the app developer during order/intent creation in the gateway.\n2. The server perform the following operation during this step. \n    - Verify: Makes a POST request to the provided `verify` URL with orderIntentKey to confirm checkout completion.<br>\n    Request payload: \n       ```\n        {\n            \"orderIntentKey\": \"string\"\n        }\n       ```\n       Response format:\n       ```\n        {\n            \"data\":{\n                \"status\": \"string\", accepted values: \"COMPLETED\" / \"FAILED\"\n                }\n        }\n       ```\n    - Capture (optional): Makes a POST request to the capture URL with `orderIntentKey` and `transactionId` to capture the payment.<br>\n    This action is optional and will only occur if configured during the addition of the custom payment method.<br>\n    Request Payload: \n        ```\n        {\n            \"orderIntentKey\": \"string\",\n            \"transactionId\": \"string\"\n        }\n        ```\n        Response: 200\n3. The server processes the request and guides the user to either the success page (`successCallback`) or the failure page (`cancelCallback`) by appending the newly created order ID in the URL. <br>\nFor example, if the successCallback is` https://example.google.com/success`, the server appends the order ID to this URL and directs the user to` https://example.google.com/success?orderid=orderId.`.\n<br>App developers can use this `order id` or the `order intent key` to get the newly created order details using [Order](#tag/ORDERS/paths/~1order~1:orderId/get) api\n\n\n## STEP 6: Finalizing the Order\n1. For instant payments, the order will be created and marked as captured after step 5.\n2. For delayed payments, the order will created but the capture status will depends on the [PAYMENT_FAILED , PAYMENT_COMPLETED](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1storefront~1webhook~1payment/post) webhooks.\n\n\n## Handle Custom Payment refunds\nWhen a shop owner initiates a refund request, the server will use the `refundUrl` provided during the custom payment setup, along with the following payload.<br>\n```\nMethod: POST\nPayload:\n{\n    \"orderId\": \"string\",\n    \"amount\": \"number\", //optional\n    \"currency\": \"string\"\n}\n```\nThe payment app developer can utilize this API call to trigger a refund request within the gateway.\n\nThe server expects that the payment app developer will return a refund ID for this request, which will then be stored in the database for future reference.\nThis refund id can then be transmitted back through the webhook request to facilitate status updates.\n\nThe expected response: \n```\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"refundId\": \"string\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce the refund request is processed from the gateway side the app developer can use the [REFUND_SUCCESS or REFUND_FAILED webhooks](#tag/CUSTOM-PAYMENTS/paths/~1storefront~1webhook~1payment/post) to update the order status within the system.<br>\nWebhooks request format is as below:\n\nREFUND_SUCCESS :\n```\n{\n    \"orderId\" : \"string\",\n    \"refundId\": \"string\",\n    \"event\": \"REFUND_SUCCESS\",\n    \"shopId\":\"string\"\n}\n```\nREFUND_FAILED :\n```\n{\n    \"orderId\" : \"string\",\n    \"refundId\": \"string\",\n    \"event\":\"REFUND_FAILED\",\n    \"shopId\": \"string\",\n    \"failureReason\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\n\n   ",
